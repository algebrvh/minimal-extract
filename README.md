Takes the `path_minimal_strict` file that `strict-minimal` dumps into your folder and pastes it as fumens for easier use.
format the command like `python3 minimal-extract.py`, nothing extra needed.
Make sure this python file is in the same folder as where you installed `strict-minimal` or at least the same folder that your `path_minimal_strict` file is in.
